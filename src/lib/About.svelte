				relatively new when it comes to coding. I am currently studying Computer Science at the
				Zurich University of Applied Sciences. I was born and raised in Zurich and was fortunate
				enough to get into computers at a very young age. After being in the field of Systems
				Engineering for some time, I am now working as a Software Engineer. Privately I am a big fan
				of all things Space and Esports. I hope you enjoy your time on my webpage. <br /><br />
